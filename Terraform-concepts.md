###Terraform
Terraform is an open-source tool for provisioning, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as on-premise and other infrastructure.

###Key concepts in Terraform
####Resources: 
Terraform defines and manages infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, DNS entries, and databases.

####Providers: 
Terraform uses providers to interact with infrastructure resources. A provider is a plugin that translates Terraform configurations into actions that can be performed on a specific platform.

####State: 
Terraform keeps track of the current state of infrastructure resources, and uses this state to determine what actions need to be taken to reach the desired state specified in Terraform configuration files.

####Modules: 
Terraform modules allow you to organize and reuse Terraform code. A module is a collection of Terraform configurations that are organized together.

####Variables: 
Terraform allows you to pass in values for variables, making it easier to manage infrastructure resources in a flexible and scalable way.
